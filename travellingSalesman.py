"""
TSP-Based Path Optimization: Given the locations of different types of debris 
identified during the exploration phase, formulate this as a TSP, 
where each debris location is a city that the robot must visit. 
The objective is to find the shortest possible path that visits 
all locations exactly once and returns to the starting point, 
minimizing the overall travel distance.
